# Insurance Data Analysis

## Demonstrating data analysis techniques using dictionaries as a data structure.

This project was a solution to a challenge from Codecademy.com.  The goal was to take medical insurance data (arbitrary data) from the supplied .csv file and analyze data using dictionaries as the primary type of data structure.  I wanted to use the matplotlib library which is outside of the scope of this challenge because I think it helps the reader quickly identify the intention of the scripts.  Ideally this work would be done using some sort of RDBMS for scalability, but the challenge again was to utilize dictionaries and context managers with the supplied .csv file.  I'm not the biggest fan of jupyter notebooks, but thought the layout would be cleaner since I wanted to show similar code for two different types of analyzing data.  In order for this to work, the jupyter notebook and the .csv would need to be in the same folder.
